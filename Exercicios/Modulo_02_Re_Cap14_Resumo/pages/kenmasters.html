      <h2>Who is Ken?</h2>
      <p>
        Ken Master is a shotokan fighter who seems like Ryu, your friend and
        rival. He's a man who gave Ryu a headscarf, and they trained together in
        childhood; he hasn't seen you along these years because Ken has a wife
        and kid, and Ryu is a wanderer walking around the world. However, when
        Ryu needs help, your friend are still by your side.
