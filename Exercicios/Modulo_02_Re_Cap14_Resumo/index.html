      <h2>Why Ryu is so strong?</h2>
      <p>
        Ryu is a character from Street Fighter; he's a legendary warrior of the
        fist and tournament competitor with your friend and rival Ken Masters,
        winning grand tournaments, mostly the Shadaloo tournament. However,
        every tournament he participated in, the corp was probably going to be
        ruined after Ryu won.
